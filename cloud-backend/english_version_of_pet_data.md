The Bulldogs are friendly and sweet, and their reputation for courage makes them an excellent watchdog.

## Health

Bulldog's hips and spines can be malformed and prone to knee issues and injuries. Their many wrinkles and folds, and tightly curled tails, mean lots of skin infections if they aren't kept clean. Cherry eye, inverted eyelids, cataracts, and dry eye are just a few eye abnormalities affecting the Bulldog. Brachycephalic airway syndrome is also a common problem in Bulldogs. Other conditions that can potentially affect Bulldogs include allergies and skin problems, several kinds of bladder stones, difficulty giving birth, and cancer. Bulldogs are also at high risk for gastric torsion.

The Bulldog's coat is easy to groom, but his wrinkles need special care. Brush the Bulldog's short coat three times a week with a rubber curry or a soft bristle brush to keep it shiny and healthy. If you keep him well brushed, he shouldn't need frequent baths. Caring for facial and nose wrinkles requires a bit more effort. The creases may need to be cleaned several times a week or daily, depending on the individual dog. Wipe out the crud from the wrinkles with a soft, damp cloth or a baby wipe, then dry them thoroughly. Wrinkles become the perfect petri dish for bacterial growth if moisture is left behind. Do the same for the indentation at the tail set and the outer vulva area.

## Type: Dog

# 4. Chihuahua

## Personality

Chihuahuas are saucy and alert with a mind of their own. The Chihuahua is fearless, never timid despite his tiny size. If you see him shivering, it's because he's cold.

## Grooming

Brush the long coat with a soft bristle brush once or twice a week. Use a stainless steel comb to remove tangles from the hair on the ears, legs, and tail. If you brush the Chihuahua faithfully, he shouldn't need frequent baths. But there's nothing wrong with bathing him twice a week. Use a gentle shampoo for dogs and dry them thoroughly so he doesn't get chilled. Never let him sit around and air dry. Keep your Chihuahua's big ears clean with a solution recommended by your veterinarian. Don't use cotton swabs inside the ear; they can push the gunk further down into it. Wipe out the ear with a cotton ball, never going more profound than the first knuckle of your finger. Trim his nails regularly, usually every couple of weeks.

Other health problems that may affect the breed include heart disease, an orthopedic problem called osteochondrosis, panosteitis (growing pains), epilepsy, and allergic skin disease.

## Grooming

Labradors are easy-care dogs who don’t need lots of fancy grooming, but there are a few essential things to know about their care. Brush your Labrador once or twice a week using a rubber curry brush or a metal shedding blade or wire slicker brush so that the hair goes onto the brush instead of onto your furniture and clothes. When your Labradors get wet, rinse with fresh water to remove chlorine, salt, or lake muck from their fur, which can be drying or otherwise damaging to the coat. Moisture in the ears can increase the risk of ear infections -- especially in a breed already prone to them (due primarily to allergies). Dry the ears thoroughly after a swim, and use an ear cleaner recommended by your veterinarian. The rest is essential maintenance. Trim the nails every week or two, as needed. Long nails can make it uncomfortable for the Lab to walk, and they can get caught on things and tear off. That’s painful, and it will bleed a lot. Brush the teeth frequently with a vet-approved pet toothpaste for good dental health and fresh breath.
